## Overview

This repository contains a complete batch image labeling pipeline designed to:

- Host a PyTorch model (`fish_detector`) as a REST API using FastAPI inside a Docker container.
- Perform image augmentation using Albumentations with augmentations defined in a serialized JSON format.
- Run inference on a batch of augmented images by querying the hosted model server.
- Collect individual predictions and aggregate them into a single COCO-format JSON output.
- Support batch inference through a dedicated model server endpoint.
- Use Docker Compose for managing multi-container infrastructure, including model hosting and batch processing.
- Provide unit test examples to facilitate reliable development.

```

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed and running on your machine.
- Python 3.7+ if you want to run unit tests or parts of the pipeline outside Docker.
- Model file `model.pt` placed in the `model/` directory.
- Input images placed inside `input_images/` folder.

## Setup and Running the Pipeline

### 1. Build and start everything with Docker Compose:

```

docker-compose up --build

```

This will:

- Build and start the model server exposing the PyTorch model on port 8000.
- Wait for the model server to be ready (using healthchecks).
- Run the batch labeling pipeline container which:
  - Augments images using `configs/transforms.json`.
  - Sends augmented images for inference to the model server.
  - Saves per-image predictions in `inference_results/`.
  - Aggregates predictions into COCO JSON format saved as `results.json`.
- Create `aug_images/` and `inference_results/` directories fresh on each run.

### 2. When finished, shut down services and clean up:

```

docker-compose down

```

## How It Works

1. **Model Server**  
   A FastAPI app (`model_server/app.py`) loads the `fish_detector` model and exposes two endpoints:
   - `/predict` for single image inference (used by the pipeline).
   - `/batch_predict` to start batch inference on a server folder asynchronously.

2. **Augmentation**  
   `a_augment.py` loads the Albumentations augmentation pipeline from `configs/transforms.json` and applies it to all images in `input_images/`, saving augmented images to `aug_images/`.

3. **Inference**  
   `inference.py` sends each augmented image to the model server’s `/predict` endpoint, saves each JSON response in `inference_results/`.

4. **COCO Formatting**  
   `coco_formatter.py` reads all JSON prediction files from `inference_results/`, merges them into a single COCO-format JSON file `results.json`.

5. **Infrastructure Control**  
   `infra_control.py` handles starting and stopping Docker Compose services, and manages intermediate folders.

6. **Orchestration**  
   `main.py` executes the full pipeline steps in order.

## Details of Components

- **Model Server (`model_server/app.py`)**  
  FastAPI app serving the model, supports:
  - Single image prediction via `/predict`.
  - Batch prediction of all images in a given folder via `/batch_predict` (runs asynchronously).

- **Augmentation Pipeline (`a_augment.py`)**  
  Loads augmentation pipeline from `configs/transforms.json` using Albumentations serialization API and applies to images.

- **Inference Client (`inference.py`)**  
  Reads augmented images, sends them to model server, and saves individual prediction JSONs.

- **COCO Formatter (`coco_formatter.py`)**  
  Aggregates all per-image JSONs into COCO format, managing unique IDs and metadata.

- **Infrastructure (`infra_control.py`)**  
  Uses Docker Compose to orchestrate model server and batch labeling client.

- **Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`)**  
  Defines two services: `model-server` and `batch-labeling` with healthchecks ensuring correct startup order.

- **Unit Tests (`tests/`)**  
  Examples given for augmentation, inference mocking, and COCO formatting.

## Testing

Run unit tests locally (inside your Python environment or Docker container with `pytest` installed):

```

pytest tests/

```

Tests include:
- Checking augmentation outputs sizes remain consistent.
- Mocking inference server responses.
- Verifying COCO formatter output structure.

## Notes

- Ensure `model.pt` corresponds exactly to your `fish_detector` model and its expected preprocessing.
- Edit category labels inside `coco_formatter.py` as per your use case.
- You can customize augmentations by updating `configs/transforms.json`.
- Intermediate results are saved in dedicated folders (`aug_images/`, `inference_results/`) and cleaned at pipeline start.
- The batch inference endpoint `/batch_predict` expects folder paths accessible within the model server container.
- For large datasets consider enhancing pipeline with job queues and monitoring.
